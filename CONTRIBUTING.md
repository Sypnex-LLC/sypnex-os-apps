## ü§ñ Development Philosophy

Sypnex OS was built through human-AI collaboration, and we continue this approach. We welcome contributions that embrace modern development practices, including:

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Feel free to use AI tools to help with coding, documentation, and problem-solving
- **Iterative Refinement**: We value working solutions that can be improved over time
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Unique approaches and experimental coding that leads to functional solutions
- **Human Insight + AI Capability**: Contributions often combine human creativity with AI assistance

Don't hesitate to contribute even if your approach was AI-assisted - we believe in transparent, modern development practices that leverage available tools.

## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### App Development Standards
- Follow the structure defined in [App Development Guide](USER_APP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
- Use proper `.app` metadata files with all required fields
- HTML files should contain content only (no DOCTYPE, head, body)
- Use SypnexAPI for all OS integration (install [VS Code extension](https://github.com/Sypnex-LLC/sypnex-os-vscode-extension) for IntelliSense)
- Use event listeners instead of inline onclick handlers

### JavaScript (App Code)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Set up proper initialization patterns as shown in the guide
- Use `sypnexAPI` (lowercase) for API access
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Use modern ES6+ features appropriately

### CSS (App Styling)
- Use app-specific class prefixes (e.g., `.my-app-button`)
- Use OS CSS variables (`var(--glass-bg)`, `var(--accent-color)`, etc.)
- Don't override OS container styles (`.app-container`, `.app-header`, etc.)
- Follow responsive design principles

### Python (Development Tools)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### General
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex app logic
- Keep files organized and modular
- Remove unused code and imports
- Test thoroughly before submitting

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

- Check for console errors or warnings
- Test app settings and configuration
- Test on different screen sizes and window configurations
- Verify proper cleanup when app is closed

### App-Specific Testing
- Test all interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
- Verify SypnexAPI integration works correctly
- Test app persistence (settings, state saving)
- Check app performance and responsiveness
- Test error handling for various scenarios

### Development Tools Testing
- Test scaffolding tools create proper app structure
- Verify deployment tools work with different app types
- Test packaging creates valid distributable files
