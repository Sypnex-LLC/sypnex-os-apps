2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sypnex-os-apps.git
   cd sypnex-os-apps
   ```
3. **Set up the unified CLI**:
   ```bash
   cd devtools
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set your SYPNEX_DEV_TOKEN from Sypnex OS Developer Mode
   ```
4. **Ensure Sypnex OS is running**:
   ```bash
   # In a separate directory with Sypnex OS
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Create a new app anywhere**:
   ```bash
   python sypnex.py create my_test_app --output "C:\my_projects"
   ```

   python sypnex.py deploy app "C:\my_projects\my_test_app"
   ```

## ü§ñ Development Philosophy

Sypnex OS was built through human-AI collaboration, and we continue this approach. We welcome contributions that embrace modern development practices, including:

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Feel free to use AI tools to help with coding, documentation, and problem-solving
- **Iterative Refinement**: We value working solutions that can be improved over time
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Unique approaches and experimental coding that leads to functional solutions
- **Human Insight + AI Capability**: Contributions often combine human creativity with AI assistance

Don't hesitate to contribute even if your approach was AI-assisted - we believe in transparent, modern development practices that leverage available tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Contributions

### üêõ Bug Reports
Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**Good bug reports include:**

- Consider implementation complexity and maintainability

### üîß Code Contributions

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-app-name
   ```

2. **Develop your app** following our standards:
   - Navigate to devtools: `cd devtools`
   - Use the unified CLI scaffolding: `python sypnex.py create your_app --output "C:\your_projects"`
   - Follow the [App Development Guide](USER_APP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
   - Use proper app structure and metadata
   - Test frequently with `python sypnex.py deploy app "C:\your_projects\your_app"`

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Deploy with `python sypnex.py deploy app "C:\your_projects\your_app"`
   - Test all app functionality in Sypnex OS
   - Check for console errors
   - Test app settings and configuration
   - Verify app works in different window sizes

4. **Package your app** (if submitting for inclusion):
   ```bash
   python sypnex.py pack "C:\your_projects\your_app"
   ```

5. **Document your app**:
   - Add a README file if the app is complex
   - Document any special configuration
   - Provide usage examples
   - Update the main README if needed

6. **Commit your changes** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new calculator app with scientific functions"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-app-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description of your app
   - Screenshots or video demo of the app in action
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Testing instructions for reviewers

## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### App Development Standards
- Follow the structure defined in [App Development Guide](USER_APP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
- Use proper `.app` metadata files with all required fields
- HTML files should contain content only (no DOCTYPE, head, body)
- Use SypnexAPI for all OS integration (install [VS Code extension](https://github.com/Sypnex-LLC/sypnex-os-vscode-extension) for IntelliSense)
- Use event listeners instead of inline onclick handlers

### JavaScript (App Code)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Set up proper initialization patterns as shown in the guide
- Use `sypnexAPI` (lowercase) for API access
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Use modern ES6+ features appropriately

### CSS (App Styling)
- Use app-specific class prefixes (e.g., `.my-app-button`)
- Use OS CSS variables (`var(--glass-bg)`, `var(--accent-color)`, etc.)
- Don't override OS container styles (`.app-container`, `.app-header`, etc.)
- Follow responsive design principles

### Python (Development Tools)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### General
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex app logic
- Keep files organized and modular
- Remove unused code and imports
- Test thoroughly before submitting

## üß™ Testing

- Deploy and test your app: `python sypnex.py deploy app "C:\your_projects\your_app"`
- Verify all functionality works in Sypnex OS
- Check for console errors and proper SypnexAPI integration
- Test app settings, state saving, and different window sizes
